# Touchline Lab

Football analysis app: team and player performance, heatmaps, shot maps, passing networks,
game states (possession phases), formations and tactical line-ups, and side-by-side comparison of any two teams or players.

## Run
Open `dist/index.html` in a browser. No server or install needed.
After editing anything in `src/`, run `./build.sh` to rebuild `dist/index.html`.

## Layout
- `src/engine.js` – data model, demo-season simulator, StatsBomb importer, all metrics
- `src/ui.js` – views and charts (plain JS + SVG, no libraries)
- `src/tactics.js` – Tactics tab: formations, tactical line-up board, shape numbers
- `src/apifootball.js` – API-Football importer (match/player stats, line-ups, formations)
- `tools/fetch-api-football.mjs` – downloads a season from API-Football into one file
- `src/style.css`, `src/head.html` – styling and page head

## Data
The built-in season is synthetic. Two kinds of real data can be loaded from the Data tab:

**StatsBomb event data** (every pass, shot and tackle with pitch coordinates, 120 x 80 yards,
each team attacking left to right). Drives every view, including heatmaps and passing networks.
Drop the event files plus the competition's matches.json.

**API-Football** (results, line-ups, formations, team and player match stats, xG where the feed
has it; no pitch coordinates). Covers the Scottish Premiership, so this is the route to real
Aberdeen data. Pitch maps stay empty with this source.

```sh
# Node 18+, free key from https://dashboard.api-football.com
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_key node tools/fetch-api-football.mjs --season 2024   # 2024 = 2024/25
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_key node tools/fetch-api-football.mjs --find "Premiership"  # look up league ids
```

League 179 (Scottish Premiership) is the default. The free plan covers seasons 2022 to 2024 only and
fetches one match per request (100 requests a day), so a full season takes about three daily runs.
Re-run the same command each day: Aberdeen's matches come first, downloaded matches are cached in
`api-football-cache/`, and the league table is complete from the first run. Paid plans fetch 20
matches per request. Then drop the saved `api-football-179-<season>.json` into the Data tab.
If players look mirrored left/right on the Tactics board, flip `AF_GRID_COL1_LEFT` in
`src/apifootball.js` and rebuild.
